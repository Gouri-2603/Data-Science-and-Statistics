## 💻 Usage

1. Open the desired experiment notebook in Jupyter
2. Ensure you have the required datasets (CSV files) in the appropriate directory
3. Update file paths in the notebooks to match your system paths
4. Run cells sequentially to execute the experiments
5. Modify parameters and explore different configurations

### Note on Data Files

Some notebooks require external datasets (e.g., `diabetes.csv`, `heart.csv`). Make sure to:
- Download the required datasets
- Update the `os.chdir()` path in the notebooks to point to your dataset location
- Alternatively, place datasets in the same directory as the notebooks
